Recipients of an invalid request-line SHOULD respond with either a
   400 (Bad Request) error or a 301 (Moved Permanently) redirect with
   the request-target properly encoded
A server that receives a
   method longer than any that it implements SHOULD respond with a 501
   (Not Implemented) status code.

No whitespace is allowed between the header field-name and colon.  In
   the past, differences in the handling of such whitespace have led to
   security vulnerabilities in request routing and response handling.  A
   server MUST reject any received request message that contains
   whitespace between a header field-name and colon with a response code
   of 400 (Bad Request). A proxy MUST remove any such whitespace from a
   response message before forwarding the message downstream.
